### Incident Response Process (Recommended)

**Current Process**: Ad-hoc (CTO and Gna notified, then respond)

**Recommended Process**:

#### 1. **Detection & Reporting**
- Incident detected via alerts or manual report
- Log incident in Jira (see Incident Tracking below)

#### 2. **Initial Assessment** (5-15 minutes)
- Determine severity:
  - **P1/Critical**: Production down, data breach, security compromise
  - **P2/High**: Partial outage, performance degradation
  - **P3/Medium**: Non-critical issues, workaround available
  - **P4/Low**: Minor issues, no business impact
- Notify appropriate personnel based on severity
- Assign incident commander (usually Gna or SS for P1/P2)

#### 3. **Containment** (Immediate)
- Stop the spread of the incident
- For security incidents:
  - Isolate affected systems
  - Disable compromised accounts
  - Block malicious IPs
  - Preserve evidence

#### 4. **Investigation**
- Determine root cause
- Collect logs and evidence
- Document timeline of events
- Identify affected systems and data

#### 5. **Eradication**
- Remove root cause (patch vulnerability, remove malware, etc.)
- Verify threat is eliminated
- Strengthen security controls

#### 6. **Recovery**
- Restore systems from clean backups (if needed)
- Restore services in stages
- Monitor for recurrence
- Validate system integrity

#### 7. **Post-Incident Review**
- Document incident details in Jira
- Conduct lessons learned meeting within 5 days
- Identify improvements to prevent recurrence
- Update runbooks and procedures
- Communicate with stakeholders
